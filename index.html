    <p>
      A shape expression schema is defined by a set of shape labels and their associated shape definition. A shape definition is defined by the abstract syntax below.

    </div>

    <p>
      In what follows, we assume a fixed shape expression schema <span class="mathbf">Sh</span> which set of shape labels is <span class="math">Shapes</span>.
    </p>

    <header>
      <h2>Useful Vocabulary and Notations</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      A shape definition is called <span class="emph">forward closed</span> if it has the FWCLOSED modifier, and is called <span class="emph">forward open</span> otherwise. Similarly, a shape definition is called <span class="emph">inverse</span> closed if it has the INVCLOSED modifier, and <span class="emph">inverse open</span> otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a shape label <span class="math">S</span>, we denote <span class="math">definition(S)</span> its shape definition, and we denote <span class="math">expr(S)</span> the shape expression within the definition of <span class="math">S</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dependency graph of the schema <span class="mathbf">Sh</span> describes how shape labels refer to other shape labels in shape definitions. More formally, the <span class="emph">dependency graph</span> of <span class="mathbf">Sh</span> is an oriented graph which nodes are the elements of <span class="math">Shapes</span>, the shape labels of the schema, and that has an arrow from <span class="math">S</span> to <span class="math">T</span> if the shape label <span class="math">T</span> appears in some triple constraint in <span class="math">expr(S)</span>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For a shape name <span class="math">S</span>, the <span class="emph">extra properties</span> in <span class="math">definition(S)</span> are the properties or inverse properties defined by <span class="math">InclPropSet</span> in <span class="math">definition(S)</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <span class="math">S</span> be a shape label, and <span class="math">definition(S)</span> be its shape definition. We say that the shape label <span class="math">T</span> <span class="emph">appears negated</span> in <span class="math">definition(S)</span> if there is a some triple constraint <span class="math">p T<sub>1</sub> OR ... OR T<sub>k</sub></span> in <span class="math">expr(S)</span> such that <span class="math">T</span> is one among  <span class="math">T<sub>1</sub>, ..., T<sub>k</sub></span>, and <span class="math">p</span> is an extra property in <span class="math">definition(S)</span>. We denote <span class="math">negated-shapes(S)</span> the set of shape labels that appear negated in <span class="math">definition(S)</span>.
    </p>
    
    <header>
      <h2>Well Defined Schemas</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      The following syntactic restriction is imposed in order to guarantee well-defined semantics for shape expression schemas. It requires that shape labels that appear negated do not lead to cyclic dependencies between shapes.
    </p> 
    <ul>
      <li>For every shape name <span class="math">S</span> and every shape label <span class="math">T</span> in <span class="math">definition(S)</span>, it is the case that the sub-graph accessible from <span class="math">T</span> in the dependency graph of <span class="mathbf">Sh</span> is a direct acyclic graph.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The following restriction imposes that all extra properties in a shape definition appear in some triple constraint of the same definition. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For every shape name <span class="math">S</span>, and every extra property <span class="math">p</span> in <span class="math">definition(S)</span>, the property <span class="math">p</span> also appears in some triple constraint in <span class="math">expr(S)</span>. 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The above restriction is not required for well-defined semantics, but rather makes the definition of the semantics easier, as the extra properties that do not appear in triple constraints are useless.
    </p>

      <h2>Abstraction of RDF Graphs</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
      A shape definition allows to define constraints on the neighborhood of a focus node in the RDF graph. Because of inverse triple constraint, we consider the neighborhood as being composed of both outgoing and incoming edges, that is of both triples that have the focus node as subject, and triples that have the focus node as an object. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to handle incoming and outgoing edges uniformly, we consider the following abstraction of RDF graphs. Let <span class="math">Prop</span> be a set of properties, that in practice correspond to the set of IRI, and let <span class="math">^Prop</span> be a set of  <span class="emph">inverse properties</span>. An inverse property is simply a property decorated by a hat <span class="math">^</span>, that is, if <span class="math">prop</span> is a property, then <span class="math">^prop</span> is an inverse property. 
    </p>
    <p>
A <span class="emph">graph</span> is defined by a set <span class="math">Nodes</span> of nodes, a set <span class="math">Edges</span> of edges, and  <span class="math">val</span> a value function. The nodes of the graph are abstract entities. The value function <span class="math">val</span> associates, with every  <span class="math">node</span> in <span class="math">Nodes</span>, either an IRI, or a literal value, or a special value  <span class="mathbf">b</span> that stands for a blank node. Finally, every   <span class="math">edge</span> in <span class="math">Edges</span> is a triple of the form  <span class="math">(node, prop, node')</span> or <span class="math">(node', ^prop, node)</span>, where <span class="math">prop</span> is a property and <span class="math">^prop</span> is an inverse property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a set of triples defining an RDF graph, the above abstraction is obtained by: 
      <ul>
	<li>For all IRI <span class="math">X</span> that appears in a subject or object position in some triple, there is <span class="math">node<sub>X</sub></span> in <span class="math">Nodes</span> s.t. <span class="math">val(node<sub>X</sub>) = X</span>.</li>
	<li>For all blank node <span class="math">B</span> that appears in some triple, there is a <span class="math">node<sub>B</sub></span> in <span class="math">Nodes</span> s.t. <span class="math">val(node<sub>B</sub>) = </span><span class="mathbf">b</span>.</li>
	<li>For all triple <span class="math">(E<sub>1</sub>, P, E<sub>2</sub>)</span>, the set <span class="math">Edges</span> contains the two edges  <span class="math">(node<sub>E<sub>1</sub></sub>, P, node<sub>E<sub>2</sub></sub>)</span> and <span class="math">(node<sub>E<sub>2</sub></sub>, ^P, node<sub>E<sub>1</sub></sub>)</span>. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, we are going to write <span class="math">(node, q, node')</span> for an edge, where <span class="math">q</span> is either a property or an inverses property. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Given a <span class="math">node</span> in a graph, its <span class="emph">neighborhood</span> is the set of edges of the form <span class="math">(node, prop, node')</span> and <span class="math">(node', ^prop, node)</span>, for some property <span class="math">prop</span> or inverse property <span class="math">^prop</span>. It is denoted <span class="math">neigh(node)</span>
    </p>

    </header>
   
    <h3>Locally Satisfying a Shape Definition</h3>

    <p>
      For every shape definition, we need to refer to the occurrences of its triple constraints. Therefore, we are going to use <span class="math">C<sub>1</sub>, …, C<sub>k</sub></span> as unique names for the triple constraints that appear in a shape definition, where <span class="math">k</span> is the number of triple constraints. Note that if the same triple constraint appears twice (i.e. same property and same value set or disjunction of shape names), the two occurrences are distinguished and correspond to different <span class="math">C<sub>i</sub></span>. To say it differently, any of the <span class="math">C<sub>i</sub></span> corresponds to a position on the abstract syntax tree of a shape definition that corresponds to the <span class="math">TripleConstraint</span> rule.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For every shape definition we identify a set of <span class="emph">triple consumers</span>, that correspond either to a triple constraint, or to an extra property, or to the un-constrained properties of open shape definitions. Intuitively, a <span class="math">node</span> locally satisfies a shape definition if all edge from <span class="math">neigh(node)</span> can be consumed by one of the triple consumers, in way that satisfies the corresponding shape expression. Formally, given a shape definition <span class="math">ShDef</span>, let <span class="math">C<sub>1</sub>,  …, C<sub>k</sub></span> be the set of its triple constraints. The set of triple consumers of  <span class="math">ShDef</span> contains the following.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="math">TCons<sub>q,C<sub>i</sub></sub></span> for all triple constraint <span class="math">C<sub>i</sub></span> that appears in <span class="math">ShDef</span>, where <span class="math">q</span> is the property, or inverse property, of the triple constraint <span class="math">C<sub>i</sub></span>.</li>
      <li><span class="math">TCons<sub>q,extra</sub></span> for all extra property <span class="math">q</span> in <span class="math">ShDef</span>.</li>
      <li><span class="math">TCons<sub>open</sub></span> which is a special constant.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Let <span class="math">Consumers</span> be the set of triple consumers that correspond to some shape definition. For an edge <span class="math">(node, q, node')</span>, we say that it <span class="emph">matches</span> a triple consumer from <span class="math">Consumers</span> in one of the following situations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The edge <span class="math">(node, q, node')</span> matches all triple consumer of the form <span class="math">TCons<sub>q,C<sub>i</sub></sub></span>.</li>
      <li>The edge <span class="math">(node, q, node')</span> matches all triple consumer of the form <span class="math">TCons<sub>q,extra</sub></span>.</li>
      <li>The edge <span class="math">(node, q, node')</span> matches the triple consumer <span class="math">TCons<sub>open</sub></span> whenever <span class="math">Consumers</span> does not contain any triple consumer of the form <span class="math">TCons<sub>q,C<sub>i</sub></sub></span> or <span class="math">TCons<sub>q,extra</sub></span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Let <span class="math">ShDef</span> be a shape definition, and let <span class="math">Consumers</span> be the set of its triple consumers. Consider a set of edges <span class="math">Neigh</span> that corresponds to the neighborhood of some node in some graph. Let <span class="math">witness : Neigh &rarr; Consumers</span> be a total mapping that maps a triple consumer with every edge in <span class="math">Neigh</span>. We say that the mapping <span class="math">witness</span> is a local witness for the fact that the neighborhood  <span class="math">Neigh</span> satisfies the shape definition <span class="math">ShDef</span> if the following are satisfied.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If <span class="math">witness(edge) = TCons</span>, then <span class="math">edge</span> matches <span class="math">TCons</span>.</li>
      <li>If <span class="math">ShDef</span> is forward closed, then there is no forward edge that is mapped with <span class="math">TCons<sub>open</sub></span> by <span class="math">witness</span>.</li>
      <li>If <span class="math">ShDef</span> is inverse closed, then there is no inverse edge that is mapped with <span class="math">TCons<sub>open</sub></span> by <span class="math">witness</span>.</li>
      <li>The set of edges <span class="math">Neigh<sub>expr</sub></span> <span class="emph">satisfies</span> the shape expression of <span class="math">ShDef</span>, where <span class="math">Neigh<sub>expr</sub></span> is the set of edges from <span class="math">Neigh</span> that the mapping <span class="math">witness</span> maps with a triple consumer of the form <span class="math">TCons<sub>q,C<sub>i</sub></sub></span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Finally, we define what it means for a set of neighbourhood edges to satisfy a shape expression. It is parametriezed by a <span class="math">witness</span> mapping. We give a general definition. Let <span class="math">Neigh</span> be a neighbourhood set of edges, <span class="math">Expr</span> be a shape expression, <span class="math">Consumers</span> be the set of triple consumers coming from the triple constraints in  <span class="math">Expr</span>, and let <span class="math">witness : Neigh &rarr; Consumers</span> be a mapping from edges to triple consumers. Then <span class="math">witness</span> is <span class="emph"> is a local witness for the fact that</span> <span class="math">Neig</span> <span class="emph">satisfies</span> <span class="math">Expr</span>, written <span class="math">witness, Neigh &#747; Expr</span>, as defined as follows recursively on the structure of <span class="math">Expr</span>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="math">Expr = C<sub>i</sub></span> is a triple constraint, <span class="math">Neigh = {edge}</span> is a singleton set, and <span class="math">witness(edge) = C<sub>i</sub></span>.</li>
      <li><span class="math">Expr = Expr<sub>1</sub> | ... | Expr<sub>k</sub></span> is a some-of shape, and <span class="math">witness, Neigh  &#747; Expr<sub>i</sub></span> for some <span class="math">i</span> in <span class="math">1..k</span>.</li>
      <li><span class="math">Expr = Expr<sub>1</sub> , ... , Expr<sub>k</sub></span> is a group shape, and for all <span class="math">i</span> in <span class="math">1..k</span>, <span class="math">witness, Neigh<sub>Expr<sub>i</sub>,witness</sub> &#747; Expr<sub>i</sub></span>, and <span class="math">Neigh<sub>Expr<sub>1</sub>,witness</sub> &cup; … &cup; Neigh<sub>Expr<sub>k</sub>,witness</sub> = Neigh</span>, where the sets <span class="math">Neigh<sub>Expr<sub>i</sub>,witness</sub></span> are defined below.</li>
      <li><span class="math">Expr[min;max]</span> is a repetition shape, and there exists <span class="math">m</span> that belongs to the interval <span class="math">[min;max]</span> s.t. one can split <span class="math">Neigh</span> in  <span class="math">m</span> disjoint sets <span class="math">Neigh<sub>1</sub>,  …, Neigh<sub>m</sub></span> which union is  <span class="math">Neigh</span>, and such that <span class="math">witness, Neigh<sub>i</sub> &#747; Expr</span> for all <span class="math">i</span> in <span class="math">1..m</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      For a neighbourhood set of edges <span class="math">Neigh</span>, a shape expression <span class="math">Neigh</span>, and a mappings <span class="math">witness</span> that associates triple consumers with the elements of <span class="math">Neigh</span>, we denote <span class="math">Neigh<sub>Expr,witness</sub></span> the subset of <span class="math">Neigh</span> that contains <span class="math">edge</span> if, and only if, <span class="math">witness(edge)</span> is a triple consumer that corresponds to a triple constraint from  <span class="math">Expr</span>. That is, <span class="math">witness(edge) = TCons<sub>q,C<sub>i</sub></sub></span> and  <span class="math">C<sub>i</sub></span> is a triple constraint in <span class="math">Expr</span>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Also, in the definition of satisfiability of a repetition shape, we required that <span class="math">Neigh</span> is split into <span class="math">m</span> disjoint sets. If  <span class="math">m = 0</span>, this is possible only if  <span class="math">Neigh</span> is the empty set.
    </p>
